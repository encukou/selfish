# Selfish keyboard

This is an experiment.

Selfish layout for Moonlander is [here](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/DapMK/latest/0),
or, with some tweaks the configurator can't do, in [my QMK fork](https://github.com/encukou/qmk_firmware/blob/selfish/keyboards/moonlander/keymaps/selfish/keymap.c).
